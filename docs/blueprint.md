## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#90CAF9) for a calm and professional feel. The hue evokes clarity, focus, and organization which is useful for a calendaring app.
- Background color: Very light blue (#E3F2FD), near-white, for a clean, uncluttered backdrop.
- Accent color: Pale purple (#B39DDB), contrasting with the primary, for interactive elements and highlights.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font known for its readability and modern appearance. 
- Use a consistent set of simple, modern icons to represent different event categories, aiding visual recognition.
- Employ a clean, minimalist layout with consistent spacing based on Tailwind's spacing scale (4px base unit).
- Incorporate subtle micro-animations for feedback, such as hover effects on calendar cells or transitions when opening/closing modals.
